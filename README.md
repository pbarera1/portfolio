1. Lazy load video and images

These are often the heaviest and most costly assets to load, make sure you only load them when the user brings them close to the viewport.

You can do this with the native loading="lazy" spec for images and with videos you can achieve something comparable with preload="none".

For more advanced use cases check out Intersection Observer or the Vanilla Lazyload package.

2. Use next generation formats

Next/Image will do this for you if you're running a server. Otherwise you'll need to resize and compress images then use the srcset attribute to serve different file sizes to different devices.

Video compression is tricky, you can checkout the ffmpeg cli tool to change framerate, compression settings, and resolution. Webm video are much smaller but I've had trouble playing them on ios, might be best to stick with .mp4 for now.

3. Use a CDN

This can help minimize latency by serving static asset from closer proximity.
